A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.
So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.
You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

//Create procedure
Create Procedure SelectSpecificCustomer
AS 
SELECT Name, CustomerId, Email
FROM  Customers
WHERE (CustomerId = 3)
Go

//Alter existing procedure
Alter Procedure SelectSpecificCustomer
AS 
SELECT Name, CustomerId, Email
FROM  Customers
WHERE (CustomerId = 3)
Go

//execute procedure
EXEC SelectSpecificCustomer

//带参数的
Alter Procedure SelectSpecificOrder @Totalprice int
AS
Select * from Orders where Totalprice = @Totalprice
Go

Alter Procedure SelectSpecificOrder @Totalprice int
AS
Select * from Orders where Totalprice > @Totalprice
Go

//执行带参数的
Exec SelectSpecificOrder @Totalprice = "10";

Exec SelectSpecificOrder @Totalprice = 10;
